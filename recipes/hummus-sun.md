Rinse a whole can of chickpeas under cold water and save the can for measuring.
Empty the chickpeas into a food blender.
Add 1 tbsp of tahini.
Using the can as a measure, add a quarter of a can of sunflower oil followed by a quarter of a can of water; empty into
the food blender.
Grate 2 cloves of garlic into the blender.
Halve a whole lemon and squeeze into the mix.
Add a pinch of coarse sea salt.
Begin to blend on a low speed.
(The consistency of the Hummus could/ most probably will start out a little thick and bumpy. I usually keep half a can of
water at hand whilst the mixture is blending; if you wish to alter the Hummus’ consistency, slowly add water into the mix
mid-blend until the texture appears smooth.)
