Pour 100g of plain unsalted cashews into a measuring jug.
Put the kettle on.
Once the kettle comes to boil, pour the contents into the measuring jug until the cashews are thoroughly covered in
exactly 2 cups of water.
Whilst the cashews are soaking, finely chop a full head of cauliflower and bring to the boil.
Empty the contents of the measuring jug into a food blender.
Add 2 tsp of Dijon mustard.
Add 6tsp of Nutritional Yeast.
Add 1 heaped tbsp of Turmeric.
Strain the cauliflower and add to the food blender.
Add an additional 60ml of water and blend on a low speed.
Whilst blending, grate a whole block of vegan cheese (I use Violife).
The mix will appear stiff.
Add 1 cup of vegetable stock to loosen the mix.
Blend in, again until mixture appears smooth.
