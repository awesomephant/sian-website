Pour 100g of plain unsalted cashews into a measuring jug.

Put the kettle on.

Once the kettle comes to boil, pour the contents into the measuring jug until the cashews are thoroughly covered in exactly 2 cups of water.

Whilst the cashews are soaking, finely chop a full head of cauliflower and bring to the boil.

Empty the contents of the measuring jug into a food blender.

Add 2 tsp of Dijon mustard.

Add 6tsp of Nutritional Yeast.

Add 1 heaped tbsp of Turmeric.

Strain the cauliflower and add to the food blender.

Add an additional 60ml of water and blend on a low speed.

Whilst blending, grate a whole block of vegan cheese (I use Violife).

The mix will appear stiff.

Add 1 cup of vegetable stock to loosen the mix.

Blend in, again until mixture appears smooth.
