Preheat the oven to gas mark 6.

Empty out 150g of wholemeal flour into a mixing bowl.

Add 1 tsp of olive oil.

Add 1 tsp of salt.

Add 1 tsp of water. (if the mixture appears too dry - add more water tsp by tsp)

Mix together + form a dough.

Melt 30g of vegan butter in a saucepan, with 1 heaped tbsp of marmite.

Place the wholemeal mixture onto flour dusted board.

Roll out into a thin and consistent rectangle.

Find a pastry brush.

Coat the first side of the dough with the marmite and butter glaze.

Cover the glazed side with a piece of baking parchment.

Carefully flip the dough so that the glazed side is face down.

Place onto a baking tray.

Coat the other side.

Cut the dough into thin strips.

Place in the oven for 6 - 10minutes; keep your eye on them, as they may need more time.

Plate on a bed of chives.
