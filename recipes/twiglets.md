preheat the oven to gas mark 6.

empty out 150g of wholemeal flour into a mixing bowl.

add 1 x tsp of olive oil + add 1 x tsp of salt + add 1 tsp of water --> (if the mixture appears too dry, add more water tsp by tsp).

mix together + form a dough.

melt 30g of vegan butter in a saucepan, with 1 x heaped tbsp of marmite.

place the wholemeal mixture onto a flour dusted board + roll out into a thin and consistent
rectangle.

find a pastry brush + coat the first side of the dough with the marmite + butter glaze.

cover the glazed side with a piece of baking parchment + carefully flip the dough so that the glazed side is face down.

place onto a baking tray + coat the other side +
slice into thin strips.

bake for 6 - 10minutes; keep your eye on them, as they may need more time + plate on a bed of finely chopped chives.
