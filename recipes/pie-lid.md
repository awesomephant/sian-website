this is really fun + challenging + youâ€™ll need a ready made roll of puff-pastry (i use Jus-Roll).

empty the contents of the pastry packet.

split the sheet into two equal parts.

one half can be used for the pie lid + the other half for the face-pie-features.

pour the pie contents into a pie dish + cover with allocated pastry half.

sink a sharp knife through the middle of the pastry into the pie contents - it needs to breathe when cooking.

begin to make your features from the remainder of the pastry : eyes, mouth, nose, ears etc + secure the positions of your features onto the pie lid.

pour a little plant based milk into a glass + have a pastry brush ready + carefully brush over the whole pie lid + its features.

following the instructions found on the pastry packet, put the pie into the oven.
