## Pie Lid

This is really fun but also challenging. Youâ€™ll need a ready made roll of puff-pastry (I use Jus-Roll).

Empty the contents of the pastry packet.

Split the sheet into two equal parts.

1 half can be used for the pie lid, and the other half for the face-pie-features.

Pour the pie contents into a pie dish.

Cover with allocated pastry half.

Sink a sharp knife through the middle of the pastry into the pie contents - it needs to breathe when cooking.

Begin to make your features from the remainder of the pastry : eyes, mouth, nose, ears etc.

Secure the positions of your features onto the pie lid.

Pour a little plant based milk into a glass + have a pastry brush ready.

Carefully brush over the whole pie lid + features.

Following the instructions found on the pastry packet, put the pie in the oven to turn golden.
