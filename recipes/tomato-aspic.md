Pour a quarter of a cup of cold water into a saucepan.

Empty 2 whole sachets of agar-agar (I use Waitroses’ own) over the cold water.

Let the contents stand for 5 minutes.

Add a quarter of a cup of boiling water to the saucepan and whisk.

Add 4 cups of tomato juice.

Add 1 finely finely finely chopped white onion. I use a mandolin.

Add salt and pepper (to your own taste).

Bring to the boil, and keep at a high heat for 15 minutes.

Pour into mould and refrigerate.

(Agar-agar sets super fast - it will be ready to eat in just a few hours. However, if you’re expecting guests I would prepare
the night before.)
