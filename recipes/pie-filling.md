## Filling

Dice two white onions.

Grate 6 cloves of garlic.

Drizzle olive oil into a large saucepan.

Place saucepan over a medium heat.

Add onions and garlic to the saucepan.

Once the onions turn translucent, add 3 cans of cannelloni beans + 1/2 a cup of Oatly cream.

Add 90ml of white wine.

Bring the contents of the saucepan to the boil and simmer for 20 minutes.

Take the pan off the heat.

Chop 10g of fresh flat-leaf parsley as finely as you can.
Add to the white bean mix.

Add 1 heaped tbsp of brown miso too + 1 tbsp of peanut butter (I use smooth).

Add 1/2 a cup of vegetable stock.

Add 2 x pinches of Maldon salt (coarse sea salt).

## Pie Lid

This is really fun but also challenging. Youâ€™ll need a ready made roll of puff-pastry (I use Jus-Roll).

Empty the contents of the pastry packet.

Split the sheet into two equal parts.

1 half can be used for the pie lid, and the other half for the face-pie-features.

Pour the pie contents into a pie dish.

Cover with allocated pastry half.

Sink a sharp knife through the middle of the pastry into the pie contents - it needs to breathe when cooking.

Begin to make your features from the remainder of the pastry : eyes, mouth, nose, ears etc.

Secure the positions of your features onto the pie lid.

Pour a little plant based milk into a glass + have a pastry brush ready.

Carefully brush over the whole pie lid + features.

Following the instructions found on the pastry packet, put the pie in the oven to turn golden.
