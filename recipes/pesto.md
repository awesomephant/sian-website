Pick a large mixing bowl’s worth of Nettles - I got mine from my local park.
The leaves located at the top of the Nettle plant bare far more nutritional than those situated at the bottom/ middle. Pick the tops.

Thoroughly wash the nettles under cold water, and strain.

Empty the nettles into a saucepan, and cover with water.

Boil for 2 minutes. Nothing more, nothing less.

Put the kettle on.

Fill 1 cup full of walnuts.

Pour the boiled water over the walnuts and soak for 15 minutes.

Strain the nettles, again.

Empty the nettles into a food blender.

Strain the walnuts, and add also.

Add a good lashing of extra virgin olive oil.

Grate 4 cloves of garlic into the blender, alongside 2 heaped tablespoons of nutritional yeast.

Squeeze half a lemon also.

Tear the leaves from a bunch of basil and, add.

Blend on a low speed.

Add coarse sea salt to taste.
