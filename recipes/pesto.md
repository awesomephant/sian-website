title: Nettle Pesto
---

Pick a large mixing bowlâ€™s worth of Nettles - I got mine from my local park.
The leaves located at the top of the Nettle plant bare far more nutritional than those situated at the bottom/ middle. Pick
the tops.
Thoroughly wash the nettles under cold water, and strain.
Empty the nettles into a saucepan, and cover with water.
Boil for 2 minutes. Nothing more, nothing less.
Put the kettle on.
Fill 1 cup full of walnuts.
Pour the boiled water over the walnuts and soak for 15 minutes.
Strain the nettles, again.
Empty the nettles into a food blender.
Strain the walnuts, and add also.
Add a good lashing of extra virgin olive oil.
Grate 4 cloves of garlic into the blender, alongside 2 heaped tablespoons of nutritional yeast.
Squeeze half a lemon also.
Tear the leaves from a bunch of basil and, add.
Blend on a low speed.
Add coarse sea salt to taste.
