Smash 4 x Rich Tea biscuits into a mixing bowl (I used a pestle a mortar.)

Finely chop 2 x tbsp of dried apricots.

Finely chop 2 x tbsp of salted almonds.

Add both dry ingredients to the mixing bowl.

Break a large bar of dark chocolate into a ceramic bowl.

Bring 1/2 a saucepan of water to the boil.

Place the ceramic bowl over the pan, fitting the circumference of the saucepan.

Watch the chocolate melt.

Once the chocolate has thoroughly melted add 1 tbsp of olive oil.
Add 2 tbsp of plant-based milk.

Stir until there are no lumps.

Pour the chocolate mix into the dry ingredient mixing bowl.
Mix together.

Place the mixture to one side.

Cut out a rectangular piece of baking parchment (I cut mine to the size of a regular baking tray).

Empty the mixture out horizontally into the centre of the paper.

Spread out horizontally until a rough tube shape is formed.

Wrap the mixture up in the baking parchment.

Smooth out all edges.

Pinch/ twist each end of the baking parchment.

Leave to set in the refrigerator for 1 hour.

Remove from the refrigerator, and baking parchment.

Cut the set mix into 4 equal pieces.

Sculpt the cuttings into rock-like objects with a small cutting knife.

Once sculpted, crush 4 plant-based (I used Oaties from Lidl) biscuits into very fine dust like pieces.

Cover the base of a plate with the dust-like biscuit pieces.

Before placing the chocolate rocks onto the plate sieve icing sugar over them.

Fill the base of a serving dish with the biscuit-dust-sand.

Top the base with the chocolate rocks.
