smash 4 x rich tea biscuits into a mixing bowl.

finely chop 2 x tbsp of dried apricots.

finely chop 2 x tbsp of salted almonds + add
both dry ingredients to the mixing bowl.

break a large bar of dark chocolate into a ceramic bowl.

bring 1/2 a saucepan of water to the boil.

place the ceramic bowl over the circumference of the saucepan + watch the chocolate melt.

once the chocolate has thoroughly melted add
1 x tbsp of olive oil + add 2 x tbsp of plant-based
milk.

stir until there are no lumps.

pour the chocolate mix into the dry ingredient mixing bowl + mix together + put to one side.

cut out a rectangular piece of baking parchment that fits the size of your baking tray.

empty the mixture out horizontally into the centre of the paper + spread it out until a rough tube shape is formed.

wrap the mixture up in the baking parchment + smooth out its edges.

pinch/ twist each end of the baking parchment + leave to set in the refrigerator for 1 hour.

remove from the refrigerator + remove baking parchment + cut the set mix into 4 equal pieces.

sculpt the cuttings into rock-like objects with a small cutting knife + once sculpted, crush 4 x plant-based biscuits into very fine dust like pieces.

cover the base of a plate with the dust-like biscuit pieces + before placing the chocolate rocks onto the plate, sieve icing sugar over them.

fill the base of a serving dish with the biscuit-dust + top the base with the chocolate rocks.
